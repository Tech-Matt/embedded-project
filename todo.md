# Todo

## Current tasks

Project
- [ ] Implement SysTick
- [ ] Choose a coherent systick period
- [ ] Make a task/process control block
- [ ] Make a stack
- [ ] Implement Preemptive scheduler 
- [ ] Implement function that computes elapsed task time (using systick)
- [ ] Implement function to handle time violation system handling
- [ ] Make a selection menu for the creation of soft tasks, hard tasks, etc.
- [ ] Maybe remove some comments

Doc
- [ ] Write documentation
- [ ] Make video
- [ ] Think about a cool name with "---RTOS" 

## TASKS
- [ ] study the scheduling of the tasks, assure there are no possible deadlocks and decide scheduling algorithm
- [ ] Search / calculate tasks funcion calls required time to execute 
- [ ] make the graphic a bit better, and maybe add more logging and user interaction
- [ ] Read about the clock Subsystem and debug clock init
- [ ] You could also implement a FSM with low power modes
- [ ] Make also semaphore init atomic (?)



## Done
- [x] Make the code a bit more readable moving functions, creating .h and etc.
- [x] Implement lcd graphics
- [x] Make the semaphores atomic
- [x] Test if semaphores are actually running
